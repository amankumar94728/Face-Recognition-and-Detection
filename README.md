## Introduction

**Face Recognition and Detection** is a robust project designed to identify and verify human faces in images and video streams. It employs state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide accurate and efficient face recognition and detection capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection:** Detects faces in real-time from video streams.
- **Face Recognition:** Identifies and verifies faces against a pre-trained database.
- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes advanced neural network models for high accuracy.
- **Scalable:** Easily scalable to handle large datasets and real-time applications.

## Installation

To get started with **Face Recognition and Detection**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-detection.git
    cd face-recognition-detection
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Setup environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

4. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

After installing the application, you can use it by following these steps:

1. **Load your dataset:** Prepare a dataset of images with labeled faces.
2. **Train the model:** Train the face recognition model with your dataset.
    ```bash
    python train.py --data-path /path/to/your/dataset
    ```
3. **Start the detection service:** Run the application to start detecting and recognizing faces.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [documentation](docs/USAGE.md).

## Configuration

To configure **Face Recognition and Detection** for your specific needs, edit the `config.py` file:

```python
CONFIG = {
  'model_path': 'models/face_recognition_model.h5',
  'threshold': 0.6,
  ...
}
```

You can also use environment variables to override these settings.
